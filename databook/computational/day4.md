This is a placeholder for a future, more polished section.

1. Optotagging - this might be able to be combined with content for VCN and CTLUT
2. Receptive fields - again, might be combine with VCN. See how similar
3. Visual Behavior Neuropixels - see if any of this isn't already represented in the databook
4. VBN get unit CCF - ideally we want this in the databook. There might be a reason so find out if there's a technical reason it's not already there.
